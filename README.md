# What is it? 
**Directory_Explorer** is a simple, multithreaded console application. Given a directory path, recursively crawls around in that path, counts number of directories, files and lines in files.

To complete this task, program gathers files in specified path, distributes them between collections. Then, each thread takes own collection of files and processes it.

Thread number (specified by parameter) doesn't exceed number of threads supported by hardware. 

This projects uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) as build system and [Gtest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) as testing framework.

# Building
Move to cloned project directory and setup the build directory with:

    $ meson setup build

Then build it with ninja

    $ ninja -C build

To build and run just tests:

    $ ninja -C build test

Both program and tests are build this way.
